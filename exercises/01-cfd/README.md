# Practical 1: Exporing Python Performance with Computational Fluid Dynamics

- Clone this repository on Cirrus: `git clone https://github.com/EPCCed/APT-python4hpc.git`
- `module load anaconda gcc/8.2.0`
- Follow the practical instructions in the browser, starting with [README.ipynb](README.ipynb)

- You are free to use a machine of your choosing other than Cirrus, however it will need the following:
  - a Python distribution (Python 2 or Python 3) that includes NumPy, SciPy, and Numba (e.g. the Anaconda distribution)
  - gcc and/or gfortran
